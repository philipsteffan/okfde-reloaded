      <description>2030Watch monitors the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Germany. The SDGs were set by the United Nations in September 2015 to be implemented by 2030. All members of the United Nations have committed to realizing these 17 goals and 169 targets. The goals include the eradication of poverty and inequality between and within countries as well as action against climate change. 2030Watch primarily uses data from the OECD, the World Bank and other international organizations.</description>

      <description>This git repository contains all German federal laws and regulations in markdown format. The XML version of these laws available on gesetze-im-internet.de serves as the source. With BundesGit the most current version of the laws is saved. Hereby, their historic development and adaptation is transparent and easily comprehensible.</description>

      <description>Fiscal Transparency, Risk Assessment and Impact of Good Governance Policies Assessed.
The allocation of funds through public procurement (services, bulding contracts, and goods) represents a significant share of state expenditure. In the EU, this amounts to about 16% of the GDP. In many cases, the allocation of these contracts is not conducted transparently. As a result, 20-25% of the total number of orders can be lost to corruption.
In order to change this, we are working together with 5 partners on the EU project, DIGIWHIST.</description>

      <description>In a democracy, it is necessary for citizens to be able to inform themselves freely about government actions. With the Freedom of Information Act, every person, regardless of age or origin, has the right to request documents from the authorities. With the FragDenStaat online platform, we support citizens in exercising their right to access information from German authorities. Citizens no longer have to work their way through the legal jungle of the federal states and the federal government to make a request.</description>

      <description>Many municipalities, counties and regions in Germany have council information systems at their disposal in order to organise committee work in local councils, district assemblies etc. as well as committees and district representatives. A lot of information is hidden in these council information systems of German municipalities. On the one hand, the entire municipal policy is documented - decisions that have a direct impact on the inhabitants of the city. If you want to involve citizens in the city&amp;rsquo;s politics and use their creative potential, it is important to provide information.</description>

      <description>The Federal Law Gazettes are the central documents of German democracy. To pass a law, it has to be published in the Law Gazette. At OffeneGesetze.de they are now freely accessible for the first time. On the portal we provide the documents free of charge and for free re-use.</description>

      <description>The central task of a parliament is to draw up and debate a budget. This essential political process decides which activities the state can carry out and which services cannot be provided. Budget data must be published by law. Unfortunately, the format is not prescribed, which means that booklets with more than 1000 pages are printed and acidified in the town hall or placed as PDF files on the websites. As a result, an essential aspect of political work remains closed to many.</description>

      <description>As part of the Open Government Network, we support Germany&amp;rsquo;s active participation in the Open Government Partnership (OGP) and the interests of German civil society in this process and coordinate the civil society network.
The network is an association of civil society organisations and individuals that has been working since 2011 to promote open government and administrative action as a holistic approach to strengthening democracy. In particular, the focus is on the exchange with the Federal Government and the development of national action plans.</description>

      <description>According to Article 5 of the Grundgesetz, every person has the right to obtain free information from generally accessible sources. That sounds promising at first. But for a long time there was a lack of generally accessible sources. It was not until the turn of the millennium that many German states took a big step: freedom of information was the order of the day. Through freedom of information laws, the first state parliaments in Berlin and Brandenburg obliged local administrations and state authorities to renounce the previously valid official secrecy.</description>

      <description>In the Berlin coalition agreement, the governing parties agreed to further develop the Berlin Freedom of Information Act into a transparency law. However, a concrete draft has not yet been worked out. We want to change that. Together with civil society partners, we have written a draft for a Berlin Transparency Act. Within the framework of a referendum, we will implement the draft law for the whole of Berlin by 2021.</description>

      <description>The right to ask questions is an important right of MEPs - and a frequently used parliamentary control instrument. In the Bundestag alone, thousands of small questions are put per parliamentary term, which must be answered in writing by the government. If you add the questions in the parliaments of the Länder, this is a huge pool of useful information, scattered throughout the various online archives. On kleineanfragen.de we collect and bundle these documents and make them - as a contribution to transparency and participation - more easily accessible for the public.</description>

      <description>After the campaign #FragDenBundestag by FragDenStaat and Abgeordnetenwatch, the Bundestag decided to publish the reports of its scientific service online. In the last three weeks, thousands of users have requested expert opinions via FragDenBundestag.de, which the Bundestag has to publish according to the Freedom of Information Act (IFG).
However, the documents have not been prepared - the list is unclear and not searchable. That is why there are very expert opinions: On this page we present the reports in a structured way and make them searchable in full text.</description>
